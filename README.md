# Uploading sensor data in Thing Speak cloud

# AIM:
To monitor the distance of the obstacle using an Ultrasonic sensor and uploading the data in the Thing speak using an ESP32 controller.

# Apparatus required:
ESP32 Controller  </br>
HC-SR04 Ultrasonic sensor module </br>
Power supply </br>
Connecting wires </br>
Bread board </br>

# PROCEDURE:
## Arduino IDE
Step1:Open the Arduino IDE </br>
Step2: Go to sketch- include library â€“ manage libraries file and install esp32 and thing speak library file </br>
Step3:Go to file and select new file option </br>
Step4:Type the program and update the thing speak channel ID, API key, wifi password and ID </br>
Step5:Go to file and select save option to save the program </br>
Step6:Go to sketch and select verify or compile options </br>
Step7:If no error Hex file will be generated in the temporary folder </br>
Step8: Connect all the components as per the circuit diagram </br>
Step9: Connect the programming cable with esp32 and PC.  </br>
Step10: Check the jumper position and connect 4 & 5 of P4.  </br>
Step11. Upload the program in the esp32. </br>
Step12 Press the boot button in ESP32 and then press and release the reset button after release the boot button </br>
Step13 Check the output in the cloud </br>

# THEORY:

# PROGRAM:

# CIRCUIT DIAGRAM:

# OUTPUT:

# RESULT:
Thus the distance of the obstacle was monitored using Ultrasonic sensor and the distance values are uploaded in the Thing speak using ESP32 controller.
